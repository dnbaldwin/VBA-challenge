#	Homework Module 2

#	Stock data multi-year analysis

Inital VBA code was written in stocksVBA.bas and tested on alphabetical_testing.xlsm file data

The stocksVBA.bas file has other modules that included that were learned during the bootcamp, and so the modules relevant to the homework project have been copied in to separate .bas files. 

The stocks2.bas file is the initial working code tested on the alphabetical_testing dataset.

The stockWorksheets.bas file is the final working version that functions across worksheets and works on the multi_year_stock_data dataset.

Screen shots for both the alphabetical_testing result and the multiple_year_stock_data result are provided



All code was written by David Baldwin
